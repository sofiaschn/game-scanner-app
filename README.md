Game Scanner is a way to run simple games directly from a QR Code, without need for an internet connection.

# Usage
Try installing the app, going into the QR Code screen on the bottom menu and scanning the following QR Code:

  <img src="https://github.com/sofiaschn/game-scanner/blob/main/src/game/qrcode.png?raw=true" alt="QRCode for a Snake game" class="center"> 
</p>

# How it works?
The app expects to read a QR Code containing simple JS code, which will then be executed. The app is built using React Native and Typescript.

# Install
To build the app, follow the steps:
  1. Run `yarn install`
  2. Run `yarn run android`

# Acknowledgements
